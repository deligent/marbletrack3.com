"Hello Mr McGlue, my name is Mr McGlue."

"Nice to meet you.  Wait, who is that guy?"

Today I made two copies of Mr McGlue.  I only needed one, but I wasn't
happy with the first one.  (nor the second one, but I ran out of
yellow pipe cleaners...)

As you may know, Mr McGlue is a ghostable character, meaning (for my
convenience) he can pass through wooden sticks.  As the track
construction moves along, Mr McGlue's big feet were making it more and
more difficult to let him pass through <del>certain</del>
<ins>most</ins> areas of the track.  I had considered removing his big
shoes, but they are glued to his feet in a way that would damage his
feet too much.  So I made a copy of Mr McGlue with short feet.
