Worked for 2 hours today, getting a bit confused as to when / how to
fix the snake around the triple splitter so that I can secure the
splitter to the correct width to separate marbles by size.

The snake had flipped the switch but the stage moved away too quickly
so I had Squarehead flip the switch back.  Part of the problem may be
that I have not been moving the stage a consistent amount recently.  I
need to start using the dots to measure how far I rotate it each time.

Here is the video including the single second or two from today.
