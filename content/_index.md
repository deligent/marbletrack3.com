Title = "Latest video"

I usually stream [creation of Marble Track 3 live on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHiQhB8J_KI2LYQ7dsexfLw) on Tuesday and Friday mornings, Tokyo time.  https://channel.marbletrack3.com

The latest videos can be seen as a YouTube playlist, available at https://mt3s.marbletrack3.com/

At this point, there is no audio in any of the videos in the above playlist.  I am considering adding verbal narration to some of the videos.  I do not yet know technically how to do it with the apps I have available, but I think it should be easy enough with Blender.

At the current rate, the final full video will be at least an hour long.
