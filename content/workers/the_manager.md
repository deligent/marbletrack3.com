The movie starts with the manager walking backwards to lead [Rabby](/workers/rabby/) as he brings in the first stage.  
The manager doesn't have a name but Rabby is my first stuffed animal from when I was a little kid.

I'm calling the manager the manager because the manager was the first person to come on to the set, plus he was there in the first attempt to create Marble Track 3 back in 2011 or so.

during the construction this time I found though the manager has really short arms, he is also quite gymnastic and that he can flip around and you can move relatively easily around different parts of the track.

As of this writing he is trying to get the triple ball splitter to be sized correctly.
