The outer spiral hasn't been created, but the plan is for it to pass large and medium marbles onto the triple splitter.

I want the large and medium marbles to roll smoothly around the entire track at least once, and possibly twice, but I will probably prefer to make the continuation of this track curve smoothly inside the middle area of Marble Track 3 instead.
