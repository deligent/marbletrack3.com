「ノリ担当」は重要なポジション。

ノリ担当 is a ghostable character, meaning (for my
convenience) he can pass through wooden sticks.  As the track
construction moves along, ノリ担当's big feet were making it more and
more difficult to let him pass through most areas of the track.  I had considered removing his big
shoes, but they are glued to his feet in a way that would damage his
feet too much.  So on 29th of September 2018 [I made a copy of ノリ担当](/episode/2018/september/three-mr-mcglues/) with short feet.

ノリ担当, meet ノリ担当.
