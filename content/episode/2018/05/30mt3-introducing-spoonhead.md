I spent a couple hours on MT3 yesterday, culminating in introducing a
new character whose job is to carry marbles onto the stage.  On his
way out, he hit the switch to reverse the stage rotation, so
Squarehead will fall because he is *just* about to jump off the stage
onto the ramp, but the stage is just about to reverse direction.
