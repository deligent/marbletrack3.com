I prepped some thigs that will make progress faster in the future.

1. I set up a "cutting station" where I can easily measure lengths of
   wood to within 1mm accuracy, which I will need to do frequently
   while making the outer spiral track, which at this point consists
   of a single segment of track about 4cm long.

2. I cut a piece which will correctly hold the triple splitter bars at
   the right distance from each other on the upper end.

3. In the second livestream, I added a bit to the test outer spiral.
