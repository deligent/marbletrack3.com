Pretty good progress today; I have essentially begun making the Lower
Zig Zag, and have nearly glued in place the first support of the Outer
Spiral.

G Choppy is walking quickly over to the Lower Zig Zag area to help cut
sticks to make it into reality.

Here are the sticks for the Lower Zig Zag before Square Head brought them onto the track.

Here is the latest snippet, which shows what happened after a
chopstick fell out of the sky.

Since June 2017, I have spent 9.6 days on Marble Track 3 construction.
