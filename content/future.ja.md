### 　● 三つの分かつ  <!-- Triple Splitter -->

　　　三つの分かつの線路はビー玉を分かえてるでどもと作らないと <!-- The bars of the triple splitter sort the marbles correctly, but I still need to: -->

* 小玉はまだちさいWigglyTrackに行かないから出る穴を切ります。 <!-- make enough space for the small marbles to pass under the bar and down the Little Wiggly Track. -->
* 三つの分かつから落ちるの中玉のtrackを作ります。 <!-- make a track to catch the medium marbles when they fall through the triple splitter. -->

### 　● 円周螺旋  <!-- outer spiral -->

三つの分かつに円周螺旋は第三さんの外回ります。<!-- Feeding into the Triple Splitter, the Outer Spiral will circumnavigate the entire track. -->  <!-- Large and medium marbles will roll around the entire track in a clockwise motion (as seen from the top),  -->  <!-- and small marbles will feed into the triple splitter from the other direction, though I don't know exactly how far around the track they will go. -->

<!-- One idea I just now had is to allow the small marbles to circumnavigate the track on an inner loop, going the opposite direction. -->

Right now [くるりん](/rg) is in the process of adding the first support that will hold up the Outer Spiral.

Though the stand-in Outer Spiral is a polygon of sorts, I plan to make the real spiral smoother somehow.

### 　● Lower(*) Zig Zag

Next to the triple splitter, I have a very narrow space to allow the small marbles to go down to feed into the small marble resting area from the other direction off of the Little Wiggly Track.

(*) Though there are not currently any plans for an upper zig zag, I guess there might have to be one later in the construction.

# Past plans

* Make a stand-in Outer Spiral.   I originally tried to do large segments of the spiral with long bamboo sticks, but they split while being curved.  I ended up using shorter bamboo skewers, which make it more of a polygon than a smooth spiral.

* Make a triple splitter.  The trickiest bit was getting the spacing correct.  As of about August 2018, the spacing is correct.

* Have the bearing fly in like a helicopter.  This was done by suspending it from a broom handle mounted above the whole set.

* Have the stage on a bearing.  This allows me to easily reach the far side of the stage to pose the characters / glue stuff / etc while making the animation.
