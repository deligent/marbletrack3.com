The outer spiral hasn't been created, I have created the demo Outer Spiral, shown in the images.  The plan is for the real outer spiral to pass large and medium marbles onto the triple splitter, without affecting any of the track below.

I want the large and medium marbles to roll smoothly around the entire track at least once, and possibly twice, but I will probably prefer to make the continuation of this track curve smoothly inside the middle area of Marble Track 3 instead.
