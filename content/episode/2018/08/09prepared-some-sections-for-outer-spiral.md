I took no frames today, but I worked on the outer spiral for a good
twenty minutes or so, making two pairs of sections, each of which will
extend the spiral by two sections, so I expect to add four sections to
the spiral next time I livestream.

In other news, I have decided to rebrand my patreon page as Marble
Track 3, although I think the URL will still be
patreon.com/thunderrabbit

Here is the pic I took for my banner on Patreon, and a clickable
version of this episode's picture.
