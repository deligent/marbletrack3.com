G. Choppy is one of the characters who has a very specific job and only that job his job is to cut wood and that's all he does.  

I tried to make the cuts happen by him raising his sword for three frames which equals one quarter of one second in movie Playback times before he makes the cut.

Sometimes he just curves pieces, and I don't have a clear timing on how long that takes, because it depends on the curve each time.

But cuts are essentially binary.  A piece is either cut or not cut, so it takes 1/4 of a second before the cut to prepare to cut.

G. Choppy, then known as "the green cutter", was in the first attempt at marble track 3 movie from back 6 years ago or so.
