Today I spent 45 minutes (livestreamed) to glue a single piece in
place.  Getting it into the right place while shooting frames for the
animation was like solving a puzzle.  To summarize the puzzle, I
created a [2-frame gif (that Patrons can see](https://www.patreon.com/posts/21571163) (or you can watch the 45
minute livestream and see it in there)).

This photo is an overview of the scene while figuring out the best way
to get the piece into the right place while taking frames that don't
show how the piece was put into place.
