Pinky has pushed the blue ball down the new track, and (IRL) it works pretty
well, but needs a bit of an inner berm, so maybe I should make it fall
down through that gap during this test so they know what to make next.

In the background, the manager has just put into place the next length
of track for the [Lower Zig Zag](/lzz/)
