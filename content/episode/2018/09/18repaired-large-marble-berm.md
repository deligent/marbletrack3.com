I fixed the berm for the large marble today in a quick livestream only
focused on that repair.

At this point, the stick still has not fully fallen from the sky; I
need to take another frame of it in the air and then of it in
Reversible Guy's hand.

I plan to work on the track again Friday, and will get the stick into
place then.
