This piece will essentially roll small and medium marbles from the
middle of the track to bounce off the outer spiral and then into the
[Caret Splitter](/p/cs) via its [Feeder](/p/csf) and [Extension](/p/csfe).

Will be supported by the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/p/csfers).

History:

* 2019 Jan 02: Planned to be brought onto the set by [Squarehead](/w/square).
