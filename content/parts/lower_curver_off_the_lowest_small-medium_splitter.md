This is just a bit of track essentially parallel to the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/p/lsslz).

Along with the [Upper Splitter off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/p/usotlsms), this guides medium marbles from the [Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/p/lsms) to the [Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/p/flmlz).
