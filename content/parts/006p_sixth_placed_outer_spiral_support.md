This piece stands at an angle from just inside the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/p/lsslz)

History:

* 20 Dec 2018: G Choppy cut the piece which will soon be glued in place by Mr McGlue
* 17 Dec 2018: decided to put it just inside the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/p/lsslz)
* 04 Dec 2018: miscounted the [5th placed outer spiral support](/p/5poss) as this one
