Nice.

It came with some little cards that can be used to focus, and some
pages that can be used to plan scenes..  maybe I will sketch some out
now.

Yesterday I ended up with about 80 frames of completed video.

I might redo them from a different camera angle, but that would mean
(starting over and) making a new shelf (or something) to hold the
camera.
