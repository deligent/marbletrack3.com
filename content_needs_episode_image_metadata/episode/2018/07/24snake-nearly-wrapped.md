Today over the span of about two hours I created 12 frames of
video.

The most difficult part was getting in the snake to properly wrap
itself around the upper marble splitter and not have the orange marble
fall every time.

In the background the gluer walked through the bridge and the blue
marble and the pink character to come glue at piece near the
foreground.

Also in the background, The reversible guy is picking up two pieces
which will lead to the bridge.
