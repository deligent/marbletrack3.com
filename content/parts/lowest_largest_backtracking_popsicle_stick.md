This is a single rail which guides the Largest Marble down from the [Snake Plate U-Turn](/p/sput) to the [Lowest Largest U-Turn](/p/llut).

When I placed it, I put it too close to its partner the [Lowest Largest Backtracking Chopstick](/p/llbc) for them to really focus on their task of guiding the large marbles, plus the characters big feet get stuck in the gap, so this piece is annoyingly placed.
