Today, Reversible Guy caught the piece of chopstick that G-Choppy chopped
last week.

G-Choppy has just cut the toothpick that was in Dr Sugar's head so it
can hold the second level of the Lower Zig Zag.

Candy Mama is barely visible in the bottom of the frame as she leads
someone or something onto the stage!
