Today I did a relatively quick livestream during which I decided to
re-place the vertical support for the feeder track into the split
bridge.

I forgot to take a picture, but I will do that now.

Here are the frames I took today.  The first one was deleted because
it just magically put the vertical piece into place.

After deleting the frame above, the frames below show the piece
arriving more smoothly into place.  I am bummed however, about the
first frame below.  [Reversible Guy](/reversible/)'s hands are clearly too low in the
first one compared to the frames before and after it.
