Title = "Latest video"

The latest videos can be seen as a YouTube playlist, available at http://mt3s.robnugen.com/

At this point, there is no audio in any of the videos in the above playlist.  I am considering adding verbal narration to some of the videos.  I do not yet know technically how to do it with the apps I have available, but I think it should be easy enough with Blender.

At the current rate, the final full video will be at least an hour long.
