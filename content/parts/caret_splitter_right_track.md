This track is only for the small marbles, leading them quick quickly from the [Caret Splitter Entrance](/p/cs) to the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/p/lsslz).

As of this writing (Nov 2018) small marbles get stuck there and cannot move forward.  I have a few ideas of how to fix it, but am not sure if they will work.
