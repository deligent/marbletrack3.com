The movie starts with Rabby bringing in the stage, led by [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/).  Rabby is/was my first stuffed animal from when I was a little kid.

Rabby was really hard to work with because he simply does not stand up straight.  I am hesitant to string a thread through his head to hold him up, but that is basically what it takes to work with Rabby very easily.
