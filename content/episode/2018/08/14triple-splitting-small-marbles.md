Probably no output video today, but I added two more segments to the demo outer
spiral, and nearly have the small marble being triple-split correctly.

In the first part of the live stream, it was super frustrating today working with the fiddly pieces of the outer
spiral which kept falling every which way while I tried to glue them.

Then in the latter part, nearly as frustrating when the small marble
catcher on the triple splitter broke.

It is being held by a thread now while the glue dries.

I have kinda lost count on how many hours I have spent on the track
(measured in terms of livestreams).

Here are frames from today:
