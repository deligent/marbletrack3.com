I am making a list of the things that
different characters did on the track to build it.  This will give
names for the important track parts, and help populate the new [workers](/workers)
pages.

The first three video snippets set the stage (literally) for building
the marble track.  In the [first
video snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g) Rabby
pulls the base into place.

In the [second video snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCbGVKKfqoE),
Garinoppi flies the bearing into place

In the
[third video snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVULwDx6hgY),
the right angle character (unnamed) helps draw a circle on the stage,
and the screwdriver (unnamed) screws the bearing into place.

In the first part of the
[fourth video snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLTq10c6FP8),
Francois drags and kicks the stage into place.

*Then* we finally get to some track construction

0:35 Big brother puts the central track skewers down, and the 
brothers arrange and place the First Track before the First Roll at 0:52

1:10 Mr Greene and Squarehead placed the Right Side Small Landing Zone

1:23 Mr Greene and Squarehead place the Left Side Small Landing Zone

1:28 Reversible Guy and Squarehead place the Lowest Largest U-turn

1:40 Reversible Guy and Candy Mama install the Lowest Back Left Small Marble Curve

1:43 Big Brother and Mr Greene set up the Lowest Largest Backtracking Chopstick

1:50 Reversible Guy and Candy Mama place the Left Side Medium Landing Zone

In the [fifth video snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bP7Irt5hHc):

0:02 Reversible Guy places the Lowest Largest Backtracking Popsicle Stick

0:12 Mr Greene places the Snake Plate

0:13 Mr Greene places the Below Lower Zig Zag Track

0:18 Squarehead places the Back Right Medium Landing Zone

0:19 Mr Greene and Candy Mama place the Snake Plate U-Turn

0:25 Squarehead places the pieces of Little Wiggly Track

0:31 Squarehead places the Little Wiggly Track Sidewalls

0:32 Candy Mama places the Snake Plate Chopstick

0:49 Mr Greene, Candy Mama, Squarehead, Reversible Guy place the Triple Splitter

There is a whole minute of video after that, but nothing much happens construction-wise; they were busy looking for the Little Brother while I was trying to figure out what to do next on the track.

In the [sixth video snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R1jgqAUz_c):

0:14 Candy Mama works on the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter, which is the last thing she does before having to take a break due to too much spin.
