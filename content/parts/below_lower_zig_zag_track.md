This is a short segment of track that runs under the [Snake Plate U-Turn](/p/sput).  It guides marbles from the [Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz) to the [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/p/rsslz).

As of this writing, it is inacessible, because the supports of the [Snake Plate U-Turn Berm](/p/sputb) block marbles coming from the Lower Zig Zag.
