Pinky is a character who was present in the first attempt at making Marble Track 3 6 years ago.  At that time was a little bit silly, but this time she's more grown up.

At this time, November 2018, she is testing the medium marble on the [Caret Splitter](/p/cs).  She will find it works perfectly, but the small marble does not.
