Special thanks to Mayumi and Jimmy for voting on the Great Tail Switch
Mystery.  Should the snake's tail flip the switch or not?

In the last video, the snake's tail was perfectly poised to either
flip the switch or not, and we three (me, Jimmy, Mayumi) unanimously
voted to have the snake flip the switch.  For me, it had been "too
long" since the stage direction had been reversed.. nearly two full
rotations!

Today the flip was switched in the first frame, and I took a total of
9 frames, which make up the last 3/4 of a second of this video.
