They don't have names but I called them the big brother and little brother they're modeled after me and my brother but the modeling is not clear some have characteristics of each of us.  They both have characteristics of both of us.

one interesting character is the reversible guy.  I noticed that he looks just about the same weather facing forwards or backwards so there was a gag during which he can just off the set and was magically going back onto the set without having had time to turn around. But via the magic of the fact that this is not real he was already turned around.

---

Another character and that was present in that movie 6 years ago is the pink character the pink character  at that time was a little bit silly, but this time she's more grown up.

---

Spoon head is a relatively new character whose job is to bring marbles to the stage. His head is made from a spoon so it holds marbles well

---

there's a character I've been calling square head because he has a bit of a square head, but I don't know any of his character traits.

---

Cameo appearances were made by Rabby, Francois, skeleton, screwdriver, and drill bit.  Maybe others I forgot.

---

There was also a character who helped draw a circle around the stage to make sure both stages were centered on the bearing
