Candycane Mom is one of the first characters on the set, and somewhat of a manager character.

She is pretty much no nonsense, but does have some compassion for her kids and other workers.

She is currently off the set after having a dizzy spell from being spun around too quickly, but I'm sure she'll be back to direct things within the set.

Her two sons work on the set.
