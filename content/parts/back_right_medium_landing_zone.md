This landing zone balances the Front Left Medium Landing Zone, and
will eventually be fed by the Triple Splitter.  It has a toothpick
placed at an angle to keep marbles from rolling back once they arrive
at the end.

#### Construction history

As of Nov 2018, this landing zone is not yet connected to the Triple Spliter.  That's somewhat of a problem because the [Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz) makes it hard to put anything under the Triple Splitter, much less a medium track.  Good thing it only needs to be short and straight.
