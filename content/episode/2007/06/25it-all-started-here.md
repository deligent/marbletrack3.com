Okay so it all started ten years ago.  I made Marble Track 2 during my
free time at work and then made this video.

People asked how I made the marble track.  It's a simple question
with a simple answer.  "I glued sticks together."

I decided I should answer with a bit more detail by showing the pipe cleaner characters
making the track.  So this set of videos (which will eventually be one
video) will answer the question about how to make the track.
