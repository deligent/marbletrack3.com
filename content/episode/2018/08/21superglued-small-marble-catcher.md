Today I felt a little guilty for using superglue, but it was just so
deliciously fast to put together segments of the outer spiral.  I got
two segments added in a relative flash compared to before, waiting for
a day for glue to dry, etc.

Then, and therefore, I superglued the small marble catcher under the
triple splitter.  If it stays in place, then progress should be quite
quick; I should be able to get the small ball catcher properly
supported and ready for testing (within the movie) next time I do
filming.

Tomorrow is Wednesday, which usually means I have to leave early for
work, but they are still on summer holiday so I may be able to do some
filming tomorrow mid morning.
