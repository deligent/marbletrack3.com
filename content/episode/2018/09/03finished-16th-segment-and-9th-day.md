Today I added the 16th segment to the outer spiral.  It's nearly
complete!  I used super glue, but ended up having to use real glue and
cutting the live stream shorter than I might have otherwise.  Tomorrow
I should be back to regularly scheduled streaming for 2 hours or so.

Oh, and I found a new camera angle that gives the live stream what is
nearly my point of view when working on the track.  I hope you like it.

In other news,

I spent the past day and a half working not on Marble Track 3, but on
the website https://www.marbletrack3.com/ which should be this very
site you are on now.

At the beginning of the livestream, the site said 8.97 days, which
mean I had a cumulative total of 8.97 days worth of livestreamed
videos in the channel.

Now it should be <del>more than</del> 9 days because I just streamed for more
than 45 minutes, or more than 0.75 hours, which is
<del>definitely</del> <ins>barely</ins> more than 0.03 days.
