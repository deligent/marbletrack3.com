In 1.5 hours today, I was able to take two pictures and glue two
pieces.  Great to get the middle of the Lower Zig Zag glued, if not
stabilized.  Mr Greene is holding it in place while the glue dries on
the upper end. G Choppy is coming over to cut the toothpicks for the
lower end so they can hold it in place.
