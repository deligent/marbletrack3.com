I had hoped to get the second support cut and glued today, but I ran
out of time.  I may have wasted too much time making sure the left and
right snakes were moving properly.

At this moment, G-Choppy is ready to cut the vertical stick that
Reversible Guy is holding.  Dr Snow and Mr Greene are working on the
Lower Zig Zag.  There are some toothpicks crawling up toward the piece
Mr Greene is holding; they will hold it securely once they are
properly positioned.

Offscreen, Shikatama-san is preparing to come onto the set with some
pieces that will be placed on the other side of the stage, once it
comes around.  I still have not yet decided / figured out what he
should bring.
