I'm calling Dr Sugar the manager because he was the first person to come on to the set in the first attempt to create Marble Track 3 back in 2011 or so.  I am calling him Dr Sugar because he is basically white like sugar, and it's a funny name in Japanese.  Satou Sensei.

During the construction this time I found though the manager has really short arms, he is also quite gymnastic and that he can flip around and you can move relatively easily around different parts of the track.

As of this writing he is working on making the [Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz)

Things finished from his TODO list:

~~trying to get the triple ball splitter to be sized correctly.~~
